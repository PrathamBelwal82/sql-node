### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- I am using curl to test from the backend.
- This is a basic overview for SQL queries + Node.js testing.
- Basic authentication logic is used. Can be modified.
- Email field is used for finding the user so not updating the email address for now . The code can be tweaked as per requirements.
- Most logics like same email or username are added through sql table only using UNIQUE Constraint.
- Used both HTTP request headers and cookies for practice while authorizing OAuth access token.
